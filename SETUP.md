2. Add your PubNub keys:
```env
VITE_PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY=your-publish-key-here
VITE_PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=your-subscribe-key-here
```

## ðŸ“± Testing Your Setup

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check connection status:**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied - Check Keys"
